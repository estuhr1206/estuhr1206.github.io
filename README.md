# Hi!

### About me
I'm Eric, currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech!

Here's what I'm working on right now:
* Interning at Verizon Business, in their Global Presales Lab as a solutions architect. Hoping to have fun directly interfacing with and testing the networking solutions that Verizon brings in the telecom space. 
* Doing undergraduate research under professor [Ahmed Saeed](https://saeed.github.io/) in the data center networking space. 
 * Submitted to SIGCOMM 23 poster session: <a href="sigcomm23_estuhr_asaeed.pdf" target="_blank">PDF.</a>

I'll probably add more here later... thanks for checking it out.
