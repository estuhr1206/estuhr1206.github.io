### About me
I'm Eric, currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech! You can reach me here: estuhr1206@gmail.com

Here's what I'm working on right now:
* Doing undergraduate research under professor [Ahmed Saeed](https://saeed.github.io/) in the data center networking space. 
 * First place undergraduate poster at SIGCOMM 23! And I got to meet a ton of great people in NYC from the SIGCOMM community. You can find my poster <a href="sigcomm23_estuhr_asaeed.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
* Interned at Verizon Business, in their Global Presales Lab as a solutions architect. Got up close and personal with automating functionality in a datacenter environment, and learned more about networking from a telecom engineering perspective.
