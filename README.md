# Hi!

### About me
I'm Eric, currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech! You can reach me here: estuhr1206@gmail.com

Here's what I'm working on right now:
* Interning at Verizon Business, in their Global Presales Lab as a solutions architect. Hoping to have fun directly interfacing with and testing the networking solutions that Verizon brings in the telecom space. 
* Doing undergraduate research under professor [Ahmed Saeed](https://saeed.github.io/) in the data center networking space. 
 * Accepted to SIGCOMM 23 poster session, hopefully I can learn more about the networking space in NYC! <a href="sigcomm23_estuhr_asaeed.pdf" target="_blank">PDF.</a>

I'll probably add more here later... thanks for checking it out.
